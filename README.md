# craftsbury_outdoor_center_meal_demand_report
A recurring meal demand report accounting for guest and staff schedules and dietary preferences from unstructured data (Google Apps Script).

This script converts incomplete, messy data from an RMS North America reservation system export file into a well structured table. Two different reports are easily built from this table.

The RMS export file contains the following fields:
Group_Reservation_Number,
Group_Master,
SecondaryGuestList_Comma,
Reservation_No,
Arrive_Date_Medium,
Depart_Date_Medium,
Rate_Type,
Res Type,
Room,
First Name,
Last Name,
Adults,
Children,
Infant,
Vegetarian,
Vegan,
Lactose Intolerance,
Dairy Free,
